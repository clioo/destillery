# COVID geolocator

# Challenges in the project
This project use postgis for geolocation, one of the problems was to get the accurate distance since geometry types are 
not accurate at all and the base distance calculatio with the SRID 4326 is nonsense, the solution increased complexity, so,
I had to implement a method that takes 2 lat/lon coordinates and calculate its distance, the calculation is accurate, you can 
check it here:
